        <h3>Aerodynamics</h3>
        <p>Today was my last lesson with the 5th grade class, and it was a fun one! They learned about aerodynamic principles and used them in order to first create and race straw-powered paper rockets and then transitioned to building large bottle rockets, some of which flew over 100 feet into the sky!
            <br><br>
        This has been such a crazy week and both the kids and I loved it so much! They were all disappointed that this was the last lesson, and were asking to continue the final class 2 hours after it started. After this, I know I need to do more in order to have a greater impact and help more children.

        <p>The last lesson with the 5th graders was an incredibly involved one, and it began with a competition of launching small straw-powerd rockets.</p>

        <p>They used their learnings from the small rockets to build larger bottle rockets.</p>

        <p>Everyone posed for a final photo before launching the rockets.</p>

        <p>These girls were proud of their rocket build.</p>

        <p>And this was the result!</p>
