        <h3>Electricity</h3>
        <p>In today's lesson, the class learned about electrons, how they flow to create electric current, and about conductors and insulators. Using their new knowledge, they created electrical circuits using various foodstuffs as power supplies to power a clock in order to find out which ones were conductors and which ones were insulators for a scientific experiment. Some children even figured out how to power the clock using their own bodies!</p>

        <p>The kids' task was to create a circuit with vegetables as the power supply!</p>
        <img src="../assets\images/ELECTRICITY2.jpg">
        <p>All the groups raced to get the circuit working.</p>
        <img src="../assets\images/ELECTRICITY3.jpg">
        <p>And the results were amazing - the clock worked with a potato and an apple instead of a battery!</p>
        <img src="../assets\images/ELECTRICITY4.jpg">
        <p>Afterwards, the kids tested which foodstuffs were conductors and which were insulators for their experiment.</p>

        <p>They discovered that humans were conductors too!</p>
