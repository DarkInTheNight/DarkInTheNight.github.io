        <h3>Support The Cause</h3>
        <p> During the Summer, I reached over 60 children with my science classes - and yet, there are hundreds more kids who I couldn't reach due to time constraints, just in one school. No child should miss out on a practical science education, and my aim is to reach even more children, not just in one school, but across the whole region. This can be achieved by addressing two factors - attracting volunteers who will be representing AralSTEM as well as crowdfunding the materials needed for the lessons.<br><br>
        
        I could sense palpable enthusiasm from the teachers I met while I was at the school and I have already set-up my first few Zoom workshops with teachers and other students my age. These will train them on the content I created so they have all the theoretical and practical knowledge to conduct the lessons and bring a hands-on STEM education to a wider audience! <br><br>
        
        However, each science lesson requires equipment such as electricity kits, rocket launchers, and much more. <strong>A lesson for a classroom of children can be funded for as little as $25!</strong>
        That's where we need your help - donations of any amount will go a long way! Your kindness is greatly appreciated! <br><br>Please spread the word about our project to help us reach our <strong>$500 goal!</strong></p>

        <p>Contact us at <strong>stemforaral@gmail.com</strong> if you would prefer to mail us a cheque, do a direct transfer, or any other payment option. This will ensure all donation money is goes towards the project rather than payment processing fees!<br><br> I will be updating the site regularly with information about the total raised and how the funds are being used. <br><br><br></p>
