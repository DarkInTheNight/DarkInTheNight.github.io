        <h3>Support The Cause</h3>
        <p> During the Summer, I reached over 60 children with my science classes - and yet, there are hundreds more kids who I couldn't reach due to time constraints, just in one school. No child should miss out on a practical science education, and my aim is to reach even more children, not just in one school, but across the whole region. This can be achieved by addressing two factors - attracting volunteers who will be representing AralSTEM as well as crowdfunding the materials needed for the lessons.<br><br>
        
        I could sense palpable enthusiasm from the teachers I met while I was at the school and I have already set-up my first few Zoom workshops with teachers and other students my age. These will train them on the content I created so they have all the theoretical and practical knowledge to conduct the lessons and bring a hands-on STEM education to a wider audience! <br><br>
        
        However, each science lesson requires equipment such as electricity kits, rocket launchers, and much more. 
      That's where we need your help - donations of any amount will go a long way! Your kindness is greatly appreciated!</p>
