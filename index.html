        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>AralSTEM is committed to ensuring children in the Aral Sea region from underprivileged backgrounds receive the STEM education they deserve, through free, hands-on science classes, teacher training, and donation of educational resources. <br><br>
        I believe that when scientific phenomena are seen by children with their own eyes, and children get to experiment using the principles that they are learning, it sparks a much greater interest and passion for the subject. By exposing them at a young age to science beyond the textbook, it gives them a greater grasp of the subject and a much larger opportunity to pursue science further at an older age.</p>
        <h3>How It Began</h3>
        <p>In June 2023, I went on my annual visit to the area where my parents grew up in Khorazm, Uzbekistan (coincidentally where al-Khwarizmi, the so called "father of algebra" was born). However, this time, there was more than just seeing family and friends on the agenda; <a href="2023SummerCourse.html">I taught a series of 6 free, hands-on science lessons</a> to the local children at the school where my mum had studied as a child. <br><br>
        By studying in London and California, I had been privileged to be able to access an amazing science education. My aim was to give a similar experience to the local children, showing them the wonders of science by applying in theory in practice. I had visited the school before, and knew that the children there, due to the limited resources of the school, were not getting the science exposure they deserved. This spurred me on to create the content for a series of lessons that I would teach to the children. <br><br>
        The lessons were an amazing experience, and seeing the spark in the children's eyes as they learned, experimented and built was an incredibly fulfilling experience that left me yearning to help more. I know that I can't solve systematic shortcomings in science education through a few lessons, but I'm determined to do my part to make a positive impact. I started AralSTEM so that we can have a much greater impact in giving underprivileged Central Asian children the education they deserve through funding science education in schools and teacher training. <br><br>
        I am now expanding the project by training both teachers and other children my age to teach hands-on science lessons to underprivileged children. However, the teachers cannot be expected to cover the price of these lessons, which are incredibly expensive for those in the region, but affordable for us. Your donations will help us reach more children throughout Central Asia, beginning in the Khorazm area.
