        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>AralSTEM is committed to ensuring children in the Aral Sea region from underprivileged backgrounds receive the STEM education they deserve, through free, hands-on science classes, teacher training, and donation of educational resources. <br><br>
        I believe that when scientific phenomena are seen by children with their own eyes, and children get to experiment using the principles that they are learning, it sparks a much greater interest and passion for the subject. By exposing them at a young age to science beyond the textbook, it gives them a greater grasp of the subject and an increased interest for pursuing science further at an older age.</p>
        <h3>How It Began</h3>
        <p>In June 2023, I went on my annual visit to the area where my parents grew up in Khorazm, Uzbekistan (coincidentally where al-Khwarizmi, the so called "father of algebra" was born). However, this time, there was more than just seeing family and friends on the agenda; <a href="2023SummerCourse.html">I taught a series of free, hands-on science lessons</a> to the local children at the school where my mum had studied as a child. <br><br>
        By studying in London and California, I had been privileged to be able to access a first-rate science education. My aim was to give a similar experience to the local children, showing them the wonders of science by applying in theory in practice. I had visited the school before, and knew that the science education was subpar by Western standards, and was lacking in any practical aspect. This spurred me on to create the content for a series of lessons that I would teach to the children. <br><br>
        For me, the lessons were an eye-opening experience, and seeing the spark in the children's eyes as they learned, experimented and built was incredibly fulfilling. The classes went so well and the children were so engaged that they didn't even want to leave at the end of the lessons, and many of them asked me to return and teach more classes in the future. Overall, realising just how much the children learnt from the classes confirmed to me that I was on the right track and left me yearning to help more. </p>
        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
        <p>I know that I can't solve systematic shortcomings in science education through a few lessons, but I'm determined to do my part to make a positive impact. I decided to expand the initiative and launch the AralSTEM website so that I can have a much greater impact.<br><br>
        Expanding the project involved identifying the two major factors that if addressed, would greatly improve the science education. First was the lack of teacher training in the sciences, which I am combating by giving online lessons to both teachers and other children my age so that they can incorporate hands-on science education into the curriculum. The second main factor is a lack of funding - teachers cannot be expected to cover the price of these lessons, which are incredibly expensive for those in the region, but affordable for us. Your donations will help us fund these classes, allowing us to reach more children throughout Central Asia, beginning in the Khorazm area.
