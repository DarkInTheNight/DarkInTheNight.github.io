        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>AralSTEM is committed to ensuring children in the Aral Sea region from underprivileged backgrounds receive the STEM education they deserve, through free, hands-on science classes, teacher training, and donation of educational resources.</p>
        <h3>How It Began</h3>
        <p>In June 2023, I went on my annual visit to the village where my parents grew up in Khorazm, Uzbekistan (coincidentally where al-Khwarizmi, the so called "father of algebra" was born). However, this time, there was more than just seeing family and friends on the agenda; <a href="2023SummerCourse.html">I taught a series of 6 free, hands-on science lessons</a> to the local children at the school where my mum had studied as a child. <br><br>
        My aim was to use the exceptional science education and resources I had been priviledged to have had access to in order to show the local children the wonders of science, by applying in theory in practice. I had visited the school before, and knew that the children there, due to the limited resources of the school, were not getting the science exposure they deserved, which spurred me on to begin preparing a series of lessons in the prior months. <br><br>
        I believe that when scientific phenomena are seen by children with their own eyes, and children get to experiment using the principles that they are learning, it sparks a much greater interest and passion for the subject. By exposing them at a young age to science beyond the textbook, it gives them a greater grasp of the subject and a much larger opportunity to pursue science further at an older age. <br><br>
        The lessons were an amazing experience, and seeing the spark in the children's eyes as they learned, experimented and built was an incredibly fulfilling experience that left me yearning to help more. I know that I can't solve systematic shortcomings in science education through a few lessons, but I'm determined to do my part to make a positive impact. I started AralSTEM so that we can have a much greater impact in giving underprivileged Central Asian children the education they deserve through funding science education in schools and teacher training. <br><br>

        I will train teachers and other children my age in the region online to teach practical STEM lessons in the same way I did, and use donations in order to fund the cost of equipment for these lessons, which is expensive in countries like Uzbekistan, where <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/uzbekistan/monthly-earnings" target="_blank">people earn nearly 13 times less than the USA</a> on average, but affordable for us.
